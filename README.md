# Password Authentication System Using Python

## Project Overview
This is a beginner-friendly Python project that simulates a simple password authentication system. The program checks the user’s input against a predefined list of valid passwords and provides feedback for successful or failed login attempts. 

It demonstrates fundamental Python concepts including lists, conditional statements, and user input handling.

- Prints "Wrong Password" for invalid attempts.
- Easy to understand and extend for beginners.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- IDE / Text Editor (VS Code, PyCharm, or Notepad)
- Optional: GitHub for version control

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand how login authentication works.
- Practice Python basics like:
  - Lists
